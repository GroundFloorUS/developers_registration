** Pie's in the oven
------------------------------------------------------------

As a startup, we’re especially grateful for your interest in us. Thank you for your support! We know from experience that achieving a big vision takes more than hard work. It also requires a community of like minds who spread the word and contribute what they think.

We’re cooking up something new and better for the world of saving and investing. In the meantime, you can follow us on twitter @groundfloor_us (http://twitter.com/groundfloor_us) . That’s the best way to keep tabs on us for now. When the time comes, we’ll email you with the big news of our launch.

Tweeting not your thing? Email us anytime at founders@groundfloor.us (mailto:founders@groundfloor.us) . We’d love to hear from you.
