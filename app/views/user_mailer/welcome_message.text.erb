** GROUNDFLOOR Developer confirmation
------------------------------------------------------------

You’ve successfully created your developer account on GROUNDFLOOR. Log in anytime at http://developers.groundfloor.us to add, edit and delete projects for consideration for funding during our limited beta program.

We are preparing to launch our first deals in August and September 2013. Our limited beta program will expand from there as quickly as possible. Once you’ve added a project, one of us will contact you directly within 5 business days to let you know what to expect.

We're looking for a variety of projects based on location, size, timeline and type. When we select your project, we'll work with you to build an abbreviated project profile and test investor interest. Based on those results, if you decide to go forward based on our forecasted time to close, we'll schedule a fundraising kickoff.

You’re one step closer to booting the bank! In the meantime, we hope you’ll join the conversation on our blog, Getting In (http://blog.groundfloor.us). We’re also on twitter (http://twitter.com/groundfloor_us) and LinkedIn (http://linkedin.com/company/groundfloor-us). You can also email us anytime at founders@groundfloor.us (mailto:founders@groundfloor.us). We’d love to hear from you.
